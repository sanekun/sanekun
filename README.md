Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

I'm a Phd student in Korea [Engineering biology school in KAIST](https://eb.kaist.ac.kr/#Main).

My research keyowards are:  `Biofoundry`, `Nanopore sequencing tehcnology`, `Synthetic biology`

I'm interested in synthetic biology, which is integrated with wet lab and dry lab.  
And also i really like data & computer science so i'm trying to create web applications or develop servicecs needed for synthetic biology.  

In master course, I studied High-throughput phenotyping & genotyping techniques  
such as enzyme screeing, pathway optimization, NGS analysis.  

From phd course to now, I'm studying Fully automated **biofoundry**.  
With high-throughput techniques gather, I collect basic data and make model,  
then make automatically experiment system based-on that model to reach **Autonomy**.
